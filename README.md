# WavePool

Simple tool to manage waves of spawns (i.e.: TowerDefense) in SpriteKit. Goals are:

- Read from pList
- Call delegate to handle the actual spawn
- Keep track of time and cleanup
- Allow pausing
- Allow predconditions through willSpawn delegate

## Example

TODO

## Status

In progress.

The WPSpawn object is tailored to my games, but the rest is fairly generic. If you're looking at houw you could use this, start with WPPool as that could work for any code base.
